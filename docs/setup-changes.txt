### Deviations from steps ###

For my mac, hadoop-env.sh is located here:
    /opt/homebrew/Cellar/hadoop/3.3.2/libexec/etc/hadoop

The following changes were made to the hadoop-env.sh file:
    export JAVA_HOME="$JAVA_HOME"
    export HADOOP_OPTS="-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -Djava.security.krb5.realm= -Djava.security.krb5.kdc="


HADOOP step-by-step setup
1) Start hadoop
2) create hadoop home directory (where adambroniewski is replace with your user name) using:
    hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/adambroniewski
3) now you can create an HDFS directory. Here we create a directory called "data"
    hadoop fs -mkdir data
4) Check that the directory exists:
    hadoop fs -ls
        you should see something like:
        Found 1 items
        drwxr-xr-x   - adambroniewski supergroup          0 2022-03-30 00:11 data
    If you get a "No such file or directory" error, you still don't have a home directory setup
